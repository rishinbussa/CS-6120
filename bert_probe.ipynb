        "\n",
        "This is a kind of experiment called &ldquo;probing&rdquo;, where we use internal representations from a language model to predict certain information we have but the language model does not. In particular, we will use a named entity recognition (NER) task, `BIO` tags on each word for the classes person, location, organization, and miscellaneous. The base BERT model did not see any of these labels in trainingâ€”although BERT has often been fine-tuned on token labeling tasks. For more on token classification for named entity recognition, and for some of the code we use here, see [this huggingface tutorial](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/tasks/token_classification).\n",

But the NER annotations we have are at the word level. We thus need to do some work to map the sequence of NER labels, linked to words, to the usually longer sequence of subword tokens. This is a common task when you have data that wasn't created for a particular language model's classification. We adapt a function from the huggingface tutorial to map the NER labels onto the subword tokens. We assign the label -100 to tokens not at the beginning of a word, as well as to the sentinel `[CLS]` and `[SEP]` tokens at the beginning and end of the sentence."
